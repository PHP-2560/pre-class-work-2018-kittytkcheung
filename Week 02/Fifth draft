# Week 2 Homework

# Q1. generate data set named exp.draws.1; find mean & sd of exp.draws.1
exp.draws.1 <- rexp(n=200)
mean(exp.draws.1)
sd(exp.draws.1)

# Q2. generate data sets with rates at .2, 5, 7.3, & 10
exp.draws.0.2 <- rexp(n=200, rate=.2)
exp.draws.5 <- rexp(n=200, rate=5)
exp.draws.7.3 <- rexp(n=200, rate=7.3)
exp.draws.10 <- rexp(n=200, rate = 10)

# Q3a. histogram of exp.draws.1
# In this data set, numbers between 0 and 1 are more frequent, and the frequency of 
# high numbers decrease exponentially. 
hist(exp.draws.1)

# Q3b. scatterplot of exp.draws.1
# The majority of the data is between 0 and 3, and there is no pattern regarding the index
# and the data value. 
plot(exp.draws.1)

# Q3c. scatterplot of exp.draws.10 and exp.draws.5
# The majority of the data is crowded around the lower left corner, but there is no other
# pattern between the data sets. For both data sets, few values are in the upper range.
plot(exp.draws.10, exp.draws.5)

# Q4a. scatterplot between means & rates of exponential distribution
ratesvect <- c(1, .2, 5, 7.3, 10)
avgvect <- c(mean(exp.draws.1), mean(exp.draws.0.2), mean(exp.draws.5), 
             mean(exp.draws.7.3), mean(exp.draws.10))
plot(ratesvect, avgvect)

# Q4b. scatterplot between sd & rates of exponential distribution
# As rates increase, the standard deviations of those data sets decrease exponentially.
sdvect <- c(sd(exp.draws.1), sd(exp.draws.0.2), sd(exp.draws.5), 
            sd(exp.draws.7.3), sd(exp.draws.10))
plot(ratesvect, sdvect)

# Q4c. scatterplot between means & sd of exponential distribution
# The standard deviations and means of the data sets are positively correlated.
plot(sdvect, avgvect)

# Q5a. generate 1.1 mill data set named big.exp.draws.1; find mean & sd of big.exp.draws.1
big.exp.draws.1 <- rexp(n=1100000)
mean(big.exp.draws.1)
sd(big.exp.draws.1)

# Q5b. histogram of big.exp.draws1
# The shape of big.exp.draws.1 is similar to exp.draws.1, in that they both decrease
# exponentially, with a high frequency of smaller numbers. My guess is that they should
# match in shape because they are the same function just on different scales.
hist(big.exp.draws.1)

# Q5c. mean of all entries in big.exp.draws.1 which are strictly greater than 1
greater_than <- big.exp.draws.1[big.exp.draws.1 > 1]
mean(greater_than)

# Q5d. create matrix named big.exp.draws.1.mat with values from big.exp.draws.1, 
# and create a histogram 
# The histogram of big.exp.draws.1.mat is similar to big.exp.draws.1.
big.exp.draws.1.mat <- matrix(big.exp.draws.1, nrow = 1100, ncol = 1000, byrow = TRUE)
matrix_hist <- hist(big.exp.draws.1.mat)

# Q5e. mean of 371st column in big.exp.draws.1.mat
mean(big.exp.draws.1.mat[,371])

# Q5f. means of all 1000 columns of big.exp.draws.1.mat simultaneously; histogram of means
# The means are most frequently 1 (or around 1), giving the normal distribution shape. 
# While the shape of this histogram is different than Q5b's, they actually agree with 
# each other, since the histogram in 5b would also agree than the most frequent values
# are between 0 and 1.
all_col_means <- rowMeans(big.exp.draws.1.mat)
hist(all_col_means)
