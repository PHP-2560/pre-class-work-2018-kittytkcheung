## Exercises

1. Read the HTML content of the following URL with a variable called webpage: https://money.cnn.com/data/us_markets/ At this point, it will also be useful to open this web page in your browser.

library(httr)
library(rvest)
webpage = "https://money.cnn.com/data/us_markets/"

data= read_html(webpage)

```
2. Get the session details (status, type, size) of the above mentioned URL.
```{r}
html_session(webpage)
```
3. Extract all of the sector names from the “Stock Sectors” table (bottom left of the web page.)
```{r}
library(XML)
library(RCurl)
data= getURL("https://money.cnn.com/data/us_markets/")
readHTMLTable(data, which = 2, stringsAsFactors = FALSE )[,1]
```

```
9. Extract the values of the blue percentage-bars from the “Trending Tickers” table (bottom right of the web page.)
